# Pursuit Wallpapers
## Web app to generate wallpapers of pursuit curves 
PW simulates curves of pursuit to generate wallpapers of intricate and colorful patterns.      
     
A curve of pursuit is a curve constructed by analogy to having a point or points representing pursuers and pursuees; the curve of pursuit is the curve traced by the pursuers.      
        
With the paths of the pursuer and pursuee parameterized in time, the pursuee is always on the pursuer's tangent.
